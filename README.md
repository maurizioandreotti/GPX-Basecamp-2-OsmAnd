# GPX-Basecamp-2-OsmAnd
This project is about creating ann XSL to refine gpx files created with Garmin Basecamp to get a more appropriate visualization of waypoints icons on OsmAnd app

## How to us the xls

- download the Gpx-Garmin2Osmand.xsl

- apply it to any .gpx file produced with basecamp (e.g. using XSL tranformation of xml plugin of Notepad++)

- open the gpx file with Osmand


At time being i am only testing this with 
- Osmand v. 4.3.0+ on Android 
- Osmand on IPad - To make it run on Ipad, make sure that the file is saved with UTF-8-BOM (if file is codified in ANSI it doesn't get imported and Osmand get stuck)
