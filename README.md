# GPX-Basecamp-2-OsmAnd
This is a project to refine gpx files created with Garmin basecamp to get a more appropriate visualization of Waypoints icons on OsmAnd

## How to us the xls

- download the xls

- apply it to any .gpx file produced with basecamp

- open the gpx file with Osmand

at time being i am only testing this with Osmand v. 4.3.0+ on Android
